# Direccc - SacredHS

This repository contains my first static website project from my 1st year in college, created as a task to develop a website for a sister school, **Sacred High School**.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **HTML**: Contains all HTML files for the website structure.
- **CSS**: Stylesheets that handle the basic layout and design.
- **Images**: All image assets used on the website.
- **JavaScript**: Basic JavaScript files to add simple interactions.
- **Videos**: Video files included on the website.

## Project Notes

- **Responsiveness**: This website is not yet responsive as it was my first static website project.
- **Design Goals**: The focus was on structuring a clean, informative site for the school, emphasizing layout and basic styling.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Direccc-SacredHS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

3. **Open the main HTML file** in your browser to view the site locally:

   Alternatively, you can drag the `index.html` file into your web browser to view it.
